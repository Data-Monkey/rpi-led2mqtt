# Simple Light 

Simple Light is the first iteartion heavily inspired by by [Thomas Hudson](https://gist.github.com/ghomasHudson)'s [OpenRGB to MQTT light](https://gist.github.com/ghomasHudson/7cc24aa187e8141003073e36e068a5a2).
The paln is to evolve this to a more class oriented code and more aligned to zigbee2mqtt with maybe a "bridge" and potentially multiple led-strips managed.

This initial version works for me.

You need to update the constants at the top of the file to match your environement and run the code as sudo.

```
sudo python3 simple_light.py
```
